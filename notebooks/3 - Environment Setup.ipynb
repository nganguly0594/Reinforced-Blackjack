    "In this section, I go through a few different potential playing strategies for blackjack and offer an analysis on each of them. Namely, the 3 strategies I will test are a Discrete Standing Strategy, a Stochastic Standing Strategy, and probably the most well-known and mathematically proven strategy known as of today, the Basic Strategy. (Another more complex strategy based off of Basic Strategy involves a concept called \"card counting\" which I will not be showing.)"
