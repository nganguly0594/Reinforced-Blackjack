    "In this notebook I go over my class implementations for the setup of the Blackjack game. I opted for a simple OOP-based structure that would allow for easier replicability to real life, by creating Card, Hand, and Decks classes. For a more in-depth look at the code, check out [blackjack_utils](../src/blackjack_utils.py).\n",

    "As a simple explanation of the version of Blackjack I'm using, a player has 4 choices on their first deal of cards. The first 2 are hitting, which will draw a card, and standing, which means the player is satisfied with their current total. Otherwise, the player can double down, which will force them to draw exactly 1 more card while doubling their bet. The final option is to split, which--in the case of a pair being dealt to the player--allows them to break their hand into 2 separate hands with each hand matching the bet amount on the initial hand. A more detailed description of the exact rules being used is in the simulation section below."

Additionally, due to the nuances of aces in Blackjack, I opted to declare an ace's value to be 11 unless the hand total would go over 21. Hence, the class contains 2 additional variables for the purposes of counting the number of 11-valued aces as well as the current card total. Lastly, each hand also has a split method in order to simplify the process of splitting a pair into 2 separate hands."

This means that for every hand total less than or equal to 16, the dealer HAS to hit, and for every hand total greater than or equal to 17, the dealer HAS to stand. The reason for Soft 17 rules, however, is that when the dealer has an ace which is considered to be \"11-valued\", they can always still hit without any risk of busting, as they can simply turn the ace into a card with 1 value. This means that anytime the dealer reaches a hand total of 17 with a \"soft ace\" (having 11 value) they will be forced to hit, and in every other situation they must stand at 17 or greater."

The `initial_money` and `bet_amount` decide the initial amount brought by the player and the amount bet every round. The `max_rounds` and `decks` dictate how many rounds of the game will be played and the number of decks to be used. The `strategy` parameter is the most important one, as it controls the flow of the game for the player. It takes a function as an input and plays out the player's turn, only returning whether the player chose to double down or not. The `strategy` function takes the player's hand, the deck of cards, the dealer's up card, and whether the player can bet more as its 4 inputs.\n",
