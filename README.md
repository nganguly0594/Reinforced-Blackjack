*Created using DeepAI Image Generator with the prompt: "A playing card with armor and a spear."*

This project is a comprehensive Blackjack game simulation and analysis tool built with Python. It includes basic and advanced strategy simulations and the training of a reinforcement learning agent to find optimal Blackjack strategies.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nganguly0594/Reinforced-Blackjack.git
cd blackjack-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the Blackjack game simulation from the top directory:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

To explore strategy simulations and RL training, open the Jupyter notebooks in the exp/ directory.

## Features
Blackjack Game Logic: Complete implementation of Blackjack game rules.
Strategy Simulations: Notebooks for testing different standing strategies.
Reinforcement Learning: Training an RL agent to find optimal strategies.

## Project Structure
src/: Contains the main game logic and strategies.
exp/: Jupyter notebooks for simulation and analysis.
data/results/: Example results and data from simulations.
